Note-Build-14:
- Compressed format:
  * Local contexts are compressed to use only identifiers.
  * Identifier table at end.
  * Fresh local context identifiers generated in different proof branches
  * Expressions are shared
  
Note-Build-15:
- Compressed format:
  * Expressions are shared.
  * Local contexts have identifiers and expression indicies
  * This takes care of shadowing appropriately (because we were not alpha-converting the rest of the context before)
